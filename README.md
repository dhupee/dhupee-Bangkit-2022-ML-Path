## What's This?

This is just my notes for Bangkit Academy 2022, no more no less.

## What's Bangkit Anyway??

Bangkit is a program from Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia to help 3,000 university students across 3 learning paths to help them grow in-demand skills in tech and prepare them to take Googleâ€™s certification. The program that I took is held from February to July 2022.

## What's Inside This Repo??

This repo contained some of my codes and pdf's I used for learning in bangkit, but no hand calculations though nor there is any answer....sorry, also there's one or two memes.
